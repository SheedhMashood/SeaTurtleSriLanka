                <h2>Fisheries Bycatch</h2>
            <p>It’s estimated that the fishing industry contributes to the death of thousands to tens of thousands 
                of sea turtles each year. Longlines are especially dangerous for leatherbacks, since most of this fishing is done in the open ocean where leatherbacks are found. 
                They usually aren’t targeting the food on the lines, but due to their large size get caught on hooks as they swim 
                by.And those that manage to avoid fishing nets are impacted by the disruption to their food supply and habitat.</p>

                <h2>Marine Pollution</h2>
                <p>Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum by-products, and other
                     debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and 
                     disrupt nesting behavior and hatchling orientation. Sea turtles are also affected by ingesting food contaminated by oil or tar balls. 
                     Tar balls form when crude oil floating in the water degrades. A large percentage of dead hatchlings whose stomach contents 
                     have been examined have ingested tar balls. </p>

            <h2>Illegal Trade</h2>
            <p>Throughout the world, turtles are killed and traded on the global market as exotic food, oil, leather, and jewelry. Over the past 100 years, 
                millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been killed just for the price of their shells. And even though today the global trade of luxury and craft 
                items has reduced thanks to conservation efforts, it still remains an ongoing threat to turtles in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas.</p>

        <p>Sea turtles are built to last. Equipped with unique body armor to protect them from their 
            natural enemies, they have swum the seas since dinosaurs roamed the land. However, in recent history,
             rapidly increasing human populations have resulted in new and acute pressures, making sea turtle survival 
             ever more difficult.</p>
