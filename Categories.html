            <div class="greenflex">
                <p>Green turtles have an average length of 1 metre and can weigh up to 230 kg. They are migratory and can be found in all 
                tropical and sub-tropical seas such as the Indian, Atlantic, Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. Green turtles are caught and killed to
                 make ‘’turtle soup’’ which is a delicacy in many parts of the world. <br><br>Their English name refers to the colour of the fat found under
                  their shells, which is used to make the soup. Young green turtles are mainly carnivorous. The adults however are herbivorous, feeding 
                  only on marine vegetation such as sea grass and marine algae with the help of their finely serrated jaws.. Green turtles are considered 
                  as ‘’Endangered’’ species today.<br><br>In addition, adult females lay between 120-140 eggs at one time.</p>

            <div class="hawkflex">
                <p>Hawksbills are also relatively small turtles; adults commonly weigh about 60 kg and measure up to 90cm. They inhabit tropical coastal waters
                     around coral reefs and mostly carnivorous. They prey on a large variety of animals including jellyfish, sponges and crustaceans. <br><br>The Hawksbill turtle 
                     gets its English name from its narrow birdlike beak, which it uses to catch animals hiding in small crevices. Hawksbill turtles sometimes eat toxic 
                     sponges. Instead of being poisoned, Hawksbills can actually store the toxins in their own flesh. If a human eats the flesh of a Hawksbill turtle he can 
                     die from acute food poisoning. <br><br>The Hawksbill turtle is now highly endangered because for centuries, people around the world have killed them for 
                     their shell. Once cleaned and polished, the shell is crafted into ‘’tortoiseshell’’ ornaments. Today, Hawksbill turtles are considered as ‘’Critically Endangered’’</p>

            <div class="oliveflex">
                <p>The Olive Ridley turtle is the smallest of the marine turtles. The adults weigh less than 40 kg and measure up to 65 Cm in length. They are found mostly in the 
                    tropical Indian, south Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They are omnivorous, eating crustacean, fish and some marine vegetation. <br><br>Olive Ridley turtles are considered 
                    as ‘’Endangered’’ species today. Arribada-In a few countries, Olive Ridley turtle nest on a beach in a huge congregation known as an ‘’Arribada’’. <br><br>This Spanish word 
                    means ‘’the arrival’’. For example, in India, 600,000 Olive Ridley turtles have been recorded nesting on the same beach over a period of a few weeks. Despite the 
                    apparently large populations Olive Ridley turtles are endangered. This is because so many individuals of this species depend on the security of a small number of 
                    important beaches for nesting.</p>

            <div class="loggerflex">
                <p>Loggerheads grow to 1 metre in length and weigh up to 180 kg. <br><br>This species nests on tropical beaches and also on beaches in some temperate locations such 
                    as the Mediterranean and the South-East coast of the U.S.A. Although this species is one of the commonest species in the world, it is the most rare nesting species 
                    in Sri Lanka. From the Indian sub continent, they only nest in Sri Lanka and they show unique colouration suggesting a unique population with unique genes, Therefore, 
                    it is very important to take immediate conservation measures to protect the Loggerhead turtles in Sri Lanka. <br><br>Loggerheads are primarily carnivorous and feed on 
                    mollusks and crustaceans. The name ‘’Loggerhead’’ refers to the large head which accommodates a large, muscular set of jaws, ideal for crushing mollusks and crustaceans. 
                    Loggerhead turtles are now considered as ‘’Endangered’’</p>

            <div class="leatherflex">
                <p>The Leatherback turtle is the largest of all the marine turtles. They can grow more than 2 metres in length and usually weigh about 600 kg. The largest Leatherback ever 
                    found weighed 918 kg! They have a predominant dorsal black colour with variable degrees of white or paler spotting. Spots may be pinkish on the neck. <br><br>They have been seen feeding 
                    on jellyfish in the waters of Arctic Circle, Leatherback can survive in the extreme cold because, unlike other turtles, they can regulate their own body temperature because layers of fatty tissue insulate their bodies. <br><br>The English name ‘’Leatherback’’ 
                     refers to their unique carapace. Leatherback turtles can dive to depths of 1500 metres in search of deep-sea jellyfish. At these depths the Leatherback’s body is subjected to t
                     remendous water pressure, but its flexible shell does not break and so the turtle can feed safely. Today, Leatherback turtles are considered as ‘’Critically Endangered’’</p>
