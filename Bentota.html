        <h1>BENTOTA TURTLE HATCHERY</h1>
        <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a popular attraction in Bentota for all travellers. The pristine golden shores that draws you to our island, also 
            provides an enticing nesting ground for several endangered turtle species from the Olive Ridley to the Leatherback turtle. The project aims at conserving 
            and protecting the eggs from predators and other dangers. Visit the turtle hatchery in Bentota to learn about these endangered graceful creatures of the sea.
        
        <br><br>The Turtle Hatchery protects the eggs until they hatch and are ready to swim back home.<br><br>
        The project also rescues turtles that are injured while at sea, due to fishing nets, motors and more. They are often rehabilitated before being released back.<br><br>
        The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is located approximately 10 minutes away from our beachfront properties.</p>

        <h1>Its Conservation Efforts...</h1>

        <p>Left on their own, turtle eggs are susceptible and defenceless against predators; there is also a danger of the eggs being found by local fishermen and sold to poachers, 
            who in turn sell them on the black market. The hatcheries combat this by buying the eggs from the fishermen at a higher price, encouraging them to keep bringing in the 
            endangered eggs to a safer location.
        
            <br><br>Once at the hatchery, the eggs are kept safely buried in sand until they emerge from their shells, when they are moved and placed into tanks for the first few days of their lives. 
            This gives them to opportunity to grow stronger before they are released back to the dangers of the sea, increasing their odds of survival. Several species of turtles are 
            saved in this way.</p>
