        <h1>KOSGODA TURTLE HATCHERY, GALLE, SRI LANKA</h1>

        <p>On the south coast of Sri Lanka, turtles have laid their eggs for generations. Swimming in from the Indian Ocean, they drag themselves up the sand on the beaches near
            the city of Galle and dig their nests, where they leave the eggs. Weeks later, their babies should hatch and make their way down to the coastline and into the water.
            <br><br>Not all baby turtles survive. In fact, the natural survival rate of newborn turtles around the world is normally around five per cent. This is all part of a balanced ecosystem, though.          
            Turtles usually lay more than a hundred eggs, so enough make it through to keep the species going. The rest become food for predators, which helps those species survive.
            As is often the case, though, there’s one species that is ruining it all. Humans.
            <br><br>The turtles that lay their eggs on the Sri Lankan beaches are under threat because of human activity – and they have been for decades. But in more recent times, 
            there have been some conservation efforts to try to address the crisis.
            <br><br>One of these efforts is the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. It was started almost 40 years ago and is still going today.</p>

        <h1>Its Conservation Efforts...</h1>

        <div class="flex">
        <div class="p1">
        <p>The turtle eggs are buried in a sandpit here and looked after until it’s time for them to hatch. Once they are hatched, they are kept in a tank for a few days and fed. 
            Then the males are taken down the beach and released in the most natural way possible. 
            <br><br>Meanwhile, the females are kept at the centre and looked after for another five years before they’re released. It’s less common to get baby turtle females and the idea is that 
            they are much more likely to survive this way. Along the stretch of Sri Lankan coast where the turtles come, there are now six hatcheries like this one. Every year, up to 400 turtles lay eggs here.
            <br><br>A single hatchery could release up to about 7000 baby turtles in a year – although, just as in situations without human intervention, probably only about 5 per cent would survive.</p>
