            <p>Our aim of the programme is simple; to conserve the critically endangered sea turtles that nest upon the shores of Sri Lanka. We hope to achieve this by:<br></p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Educating the local community about the importance of sea turtles and the environment (plastic, littering etc.)</li>
                <li>Provide a new income to local poachers (assisting volunteers, tours and many other ideas) to gradually decrease their presence.</li>
                <li>Collect vital research data about nesting turtles and our hatchery's success rate to provide to the government to then look at imposing stricter legislations 
                    regarding poaching and turtle sanctuaries.</li>
                    <li>Create a tour permit system whereby former poachers and sanctuary staff take tourists onto nesting beaches in a safe and ethical way - therefore 
                        reducing the need for income from traditional sanctuaries.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            With five of the seven sea turtle species (Hawksbill, Green, Loggerhead, Olive Ridley and Leatherback) being regularly found along the coast of Sri Lanka, there 
            is no better place to volunteer to ensure these amazing animals have the best chance of survival. Although the nesting season is at its peak from November to May,
             there are turtles coming ashore regularly all year round!

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Marine Turtles have inhabited the earth for over 100 million years and have evolved from tortoise-like animals. They have a head, neck, fore and hind flippers, and a tail, 
            and their jaws can crush, tear or bite depending on their diet.<br><br> 

            Turtles are reptiles hence cold-blooded animals. Therefore, the environment determines their body temperature. In the morning, marine turtles ‘’ sunbathe’’ at the surface of the sea to 
            increase their body temperature. Turtles rise to the surface to breathe every – 30 minutes. Over millions of years they have become very well adapted to living in a marine environment. 
            With their long and muscular oar-like fore flippers, rudder-like hind flippers and their flattened, streamlined shells, marine turtles are fast and agile swimmers. <br><br>

            Marine turtles are highly migratory, moving between nesting and feeding grounds thousands of kilometres apart. Males spend all their time at sea and little is known about their
            habits. Scientists believe marine turtles use the earth's magnetic field for navigation. Seven species remain, all of which are threatened with extinction due to man's destructive activities.</p>

        <h1>Mating & Nesting Behaviour</h1>
        <p>
            Turtles mate mostly during the daytime in shallow offshore waters. Adult male turtles have well developed claws to hold the female firmly while mating. Female turtles nest at night
             because it is cooler and less conspicuous to large predators. Once they find a suitable site, they use their front flippers to scrape a large body pit and dig a precise shaped egg chamber. 
             The eggs of most species are about the size and shape of a table-tennis ball, while the eggs of the Leatherback turtles are considerably larger.<br><br>

            Turtle eggs have a soft shell and are not damaged as they are dropped into the nest. Sometimes, the female will guide the eggs down into the nest with a curved rear flipper.<br><br>
        
            The female turtle uses her hind flippers to fill in the egg chamber and disguise the exact location of the nest. This process is known as Camouflaging and can take up to 3 hours. Finally, 
            the female turtle returns to the ocean and nests again within 9-12 days. Within a single nesting season, a female turtle can nest up to 12 times, depending on the species. When the nesting 
            season is completed, the female turtle migrates to her foraging ground thousands of miles away from her nesting ground.

        <h1>Incubations & Hatchlings Behaviour</h1>
        <p>
            Mother turtles do not care for their young like crocodiles and some other reptiles. Instead, once the eggs are laid the female turtle does not have any further contact 
            with the nest and the eggs are left to incubate by the heat of the surrounding sand that is warmed by the sun. After an incubation period of about 60 days the young turtles 
            or ‘’hatchlings’’ begin to break out of their shells and move about in the nest. After a further 2 days most of the eggs will have hatched. The movement of all the hatchlings causes 
            sand from the roof and sides of the nest to fall down to the floor and form a platform. This platform rises as more sand falls and the hatchlings are pushed to the surface with 
            and ‘’elevator-like’’ movement. The hatchlings emerge from the nest at night when it is cooler and they are less conspicuous to predators.<br><br>

            The most important details in this text are that young turtles crawl towards the brightest, lowest horizon, which is the reflection of the moon and stars on the sea. 
            Even those that reach the water are not out of danger, as the inshore waters are home to many sharks, large fish and seabirds. As soon as they reach the sea, hatchlings 
            swim constantly for about 48 hours without feeding and rely on the remains of the egg yolk in their stomachs for nutrition. It is believed that when the female turtles reach 
            maturity, they will return to nest on the same beach where they themselves hatched. It is estimated that only one in a thousand eggs survive eventually to become mature adult turtles.
